                <h2 class="texto">Greek Expansion:</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="texto"> - Greece's acquisition of southern Macedonia and the island of Crete not only expanded its territory but also contributed to the consolidation of Greek national aspirations. The incorporation of southern Macedonia was particularly significant given the historical and cultural ties of this region to Greece. However, it also set the stage for future disputes with Bulgaria over northern Macedonia.</p>

                <h2 class="texto">Serbian Territorial Gains:</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="texto"> - Serbia's expansion into the Kosovo region and northern and central Macedonia increased its influence in the Balkans. The acquisition of Kosovo held cultural and historical importance for Serbia, but the incorporation of northern and central Macedonia introduced a diverse population, including different ethnic groups. This diversity would later pose challenges to Serbian state-building efforts.</p>

                <h2 class="texto">Albanian Independence:</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="texto"> - The establishment of Albania as an independent state was a response to the complex ethnic and religious composition of the region. Placing Albania under the rule of a German prince reflected the geopolitical considerations of the time, with European powers having a role in shaping the political landscape in the Balkans. This arrangement, however, did not last long, as internal and external pressures led to political changes in Albania.

                <br>
                <p class="texto"> - The Balkan Wars and the subsequent territorial adjustments significantly altered the political map of the region. The power dynamics shifted, and new states emerged or expanded, setting the stage for the intricate web of alliances and rivalries that would characterize the Balkans in the lead-up to World War I.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="texto"> - The outcomes of the Balkan Wars had long-term consequences for the stability and peace in the region. The redrawing of borders and the establishment of new states created a complex mosaic of ethnicities and territorial claims, laying the groundwork for future conflicts and geopolitical tensions in the Balkans.</p>
