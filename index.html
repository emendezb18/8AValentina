    <h1><center>2nd Balkan War</center></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p><center><h2>Introduction:</h2></center>
    <br>
    <p class="texto">The Balkan Wars, occurring from 1912 to 1913 in southeastern Europe, involved the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League comprising Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia. Initially aimed at ousting the Ottomans from the peninsula, the first war succeeded in this goal. However, disputes over the division of the newly acquired territories sparked the second Balkan War among the smaller Balkan nations.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="texto">The Treaty of Bucharest ended the conflicts but left the region in an unstable state. The defeated Bulgarians sought revenge, creating a delicate balance. Additionally, Greek and Serbian nationalists, unsatisfied with the outcomes, remained eager to expand their territories at the expense of the Ottomans and Austro-Hungarians, respectively.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="texto">Before the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman conquest of the Balkan peninsula in the late 15th century ushered in a relatively peaceful period. However, the rise of nationalism in Western Europe during the late 18th and early 19th centuries reignited a desire among Balkan groups to establish nation-states by removing Turkish influence. Although initially directed against the Ottomans, these nationalistic aspirations eventually led to conflicts among the Balkan nations due to incompatible territorial ambitions.</p>
